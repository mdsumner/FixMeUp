<H1>Why ride a fixed gear?</H1>

<P>
This is a difficult question to answer on as impersonal a medium
as the Web.  The best analogy I've been able to come up with is that
riding a multi-speed bike -- and especially one with index shifting --
is like driving a car with an automatic transmission.  Riding a fixed-gear
bike (or a single speed, to a lesser extent) is like driving a sports car
with a manual transmission.  Other than on a freeway during rush hour....
</P>

<P>
Riding fixed puts you closer to the pavement.  You <EM>know</EM> when
the road turns up or down.  Simple maneuvers like turning require that
you concentrate fully on your relationship with the bike.
</P>

<P>
Riding fixed is an incredible workout.  Think for a minute how
often you coast during a ride.  On a fixed gear, you can&#39;t coast.  Ever.
If you don't use your brakes (a strategy I no longer advocate: it's pretty
hard on the knees), downhills become the toughest part of your rides.
</P>

<P>
The first time I rode fixed, I was hooked.  Maybe that&#39;s why I believe
that experiencing it is the only way to really understand.  Try borrowing
a fixed gear bike from a friend if you can.  You&#39;ll have a hard time
giving it back.
