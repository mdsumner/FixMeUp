<P>
Fixed Innovations is a small web-only business selling special eccentric
axles that increase the number of usable gears when a frame with vertical
dropouts is used as a fixed-gear or single-speed.
</P>

<P>
We also sell hubs for fixed-gears and single-speeds, quick-releases for
those hubs, and Craig's SuperLinks to make chain swapping easier.  That's
all we sell: we&#39;re not interested in competing with your local shop in
the areas where they have expertise.
</P>

<P>
For a description of our products, see our <A HREF="products.php">products
page</A>.
</P>

<P> To order from Fixed Innovations, please see our <A
HREF="order.php">order form</A>.  Or just send <a href="mailto:fixin@eehouse.org">mail</a>.</P>

<P> As always, don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:fixin@eehouse.org">mail</a> us with any
questions or comments.  </P>
